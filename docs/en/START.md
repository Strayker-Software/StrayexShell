# Introduction to Strayex Shell

Strayex Shell is Command Line Interface with support for most popular OSes and hobby OSes.
It's target is to be the simpliest shell for hobby OS/Dev and to serve custom environment in Windows and Linux.

Every platform's version is written in another language. Why? Because I want to leanr more about these languages.
The basic feature of Strayex Shell is to serve CLI for my hobby OS called StrayexOS.
Any other version is extension.

In file "COMMANDS.md" is list of every command and it's description in shell in every shell's platform.
